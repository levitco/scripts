#Wifi


## Conectarme a una red wifi

*ifconfig: Enable your wireless device.
*iwlist: List the available wireless access points.
*iwconfig: Configure your wireless connection.
*dhclient: Get your IP Address via dhcp.
*wpa_supplicant: For use with WPA authentication.

## escanear

iwlist MINETWORKCARD scan

## conectar

iwconfig MINETWORKCARD essid NETWORKNAME key s:WIRELESSKEY

## luego darle ip a mi maquina

dhclient MINETWORK CARD

WPA

For WPA-based networks you will need to take a different approach. Do the following:

1. Issue the command wpa_passphrase SSID PASSWORDÂ¬â (Where SSID is your network ID and PASSWORD is your wireless password). This will generate a psk string that you will use in the configuration file.

2. Edit the /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf file to reflect:

Network={

Â¬â Â¬â  ssid=SSID

Â¬â Â¬â  psk=PSK

}

Where SSID is the actual ID of your wireless network and PSK is the string generated by the wpa_passphrase command.

3. Run the wpa_supplicant daemon with the command:

wpa_supplicant -B -i INTERFACE -DWext -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf

Where INTERFACE is the name of your wireless interface.

4. Now make sure you are associated with your network with the command iwconfig INTERFACE (Where INTERFACE is the name of your wireless interface).

5. Get an IP address with the command: dhclient INTERFACE (Where INTERFACE is the name of your wireless interface).

You should now be on the wireless network.

You can automate this by creating an entry in /etc/network/interfaces like this:

auto INTERFACE

iface INTERFACE inet dhcp

Â¬â Â¬â  pre-up wpa_supplicant -Bw -Dwext -i INTERFACE -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf

Â¬â Â¬â post-down killall -q wpa_supplicant

Where INTERFACE is the name of your wireless interface.Â¬â
